# Code Generation with sqlc

The project uses sqlc for generating type-safe Go code from SQL queries.

```bash
# Generate sqlc code (after modifying SQL queries)
sqlc generate

# Add new SQL queries
mkdir -p internal/database/queries/postgres internal/database/queries/mysql
# Add .sql files with query definitions
# Run sqlc generate to create Go code
```

### Query Organization
- **PostgreSQL queries**: `internal/database/queries/postgres/*.sql`
- **MySQL queries**: `internal/database/queries/mysql/*.sql`
- **Generated code**: `internal/database/generated/{postgres,mysql}/`

### Usage in Services
```go
// PostgreSQL
result, err := db.Postgres.GetMovieByID(ctx, movieID)

// MySQL
result, err := db.MySQL.GetMovieByID(ctx, movieID)
```

## Code Quality and Formatting Standards

### Required Quality Checks
**CRITICAL**: Before committing any code changes, ALWAYS run the linting tests to ensure code quality:

- **Pre-commit hooks (Recommended)**: Install pre-commit hooks to automatically run quality checks before each commit
  - Install: `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`
  - Hooks will automatically run: `go fmt`, `go mod tidy`, `golangci-lint`, `go test`, and security checks
- **Manual checks**: Run `make lint` to verify all code passes golangci-lint checks
- Fix any linting errors before committing
- Ensure code follows Go conventions and project standards
- All commits must pass CI pipeline quality checks

### Code Formatting Standards

#### Go Code Formatting
- **Use `gofmt`**: All Go code must be formatted with `gofmt -s` (run `make fmt`)
- **Import Organization**: Group imports in this order:
  1. Standard library packages
  2. Third-party packages
  3. Local project packages
- **Line Length**: Maximum 120 characters per line (enforced by `lll` linter)
- **Function Length**: Maximum 40 statements per function (enforced by `funlen` linter)

#### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: Use camelCase (`userID`, `movieFile`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_PORT`)
- **Functions/Methods**: Use camelCase (`GetMovie`, `CreateIndexer`)
- **Types**: Use PascalCase (`MovieService`, `QualityProfile`)
- **Interfaces**: Use PascalCase with descriptive names (`MovieRepository`, `Logger`)
- **Packages**: Use lowercase, single words when possible (`api`, `models`, `services`)

#### Documentation Standards
- **Public Functions**: All exported functions must have documentation comments
- **Public Types**: All exported types must have documentation comments
- **Package Documentation**: Each package must have a package-level comment
- **Comment Format**: Use complete sentences, start with the function/type name
```go
// GetMovie retrieves a movie by its ID from the database.
func GetMovie(id int) (*Movie, error) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Error Handling
- **Error Wrapping**: Use `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` verb for error context
- **Error Messages**: Use lowercase, no punctuation at end
- **Error Variables**: Use `Err` prefix for error variables (`ErrNotFound`)
```go
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to fetch movie with id %d: %w", id, err)
}
```

#### Code Structure
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function should do one thing
- **Small Functions**: Keep functions focused and testable
- **Clear Variable Names**: Use descriptive names over comments
- **Early Returns**: Use guard clauses to reduce nesting
```go
func ProcessMovie(movie *Movie) error {
    if movie == nil {
        return ErrInvalidMovie
    }

    if movie.ID == 0 {
        return ErrMissingID
    }

    // Process movie
    return nil
}
```

### Enabled Linters
The project uses golangci-lint with these enabled linters:
- **bodyclose**: Checks HTTP response body is closed
- **errcheck**: Checks unchecked errors
- **gosec**: Security analysis
- **govet**: Examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs
- **ineffassign**: Detects ineffectual assignments
- **misspell**: Finds commonly misspelled English words
- **revive**: Replacement for golint with more rules
- **staticcheck**: Advanced Go linter
- **unused**: Checks for unused constants, variables, functions, and types
- **whitespace**: Checks for unnecessary whitespace

### SQL and Migration Standards
- **File Naming**: Use sequential numbering (`001_initial_schema.up.sql`)
- **Reversible Changes**: Always provide corresponding `.down.sql` files
- **Column Naming**: Use snake_case (`created_at`, `movie_id`)
- **Table Naming**: Use snake_case plural (`movies`, `quality_profiles`)
- **Foreign Keys**: Use `_id` suffix (`movie_id`, `quality_profile_id`)

### JSON and API Standards
- **JSON Tags**: Use camelCase for JSON field names
- **Struct Tags**: Include both `json` and `gorm` tags
```go
type Movie struct {
    ID          int       `json:"id" gorm:"primaryKey;autoIncrement"`
    Title       string    `json:"title" gorm:"not null;size:255"`
    ReleaseDate time.Time `json:"releaseDate" gorm:"not null"`
}
```

### Testing Standards
- **Test File Naming**: Use `_test.go` suffix
- **Test Function Naming**: Use `TestFunctionName` format
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >80% test coverage
- **Test Organization**: Group related tests in subtests using `t.Run()`
- **Mock Usage**: Use interfaces for dependency injection and mocking

### Git Commit Standards
- **Commit Message Format**: Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- **Scope**: Include scope when relevant (`feat(api):`, `fix(database):`)
- **Line Length**: Keep first line under 72 characters
- **Body**: Include detailed explanation for complex changes

## Documentation Maintenance

**CRITICAL**: When making changes to the codebase, ALWAYS update documentation to reflect those changes:

- Update CLAUDE.md with new development commands, architecture changes, or workflow modifications
- Update README.md with new features, installation steps, or usage instructions
- Update versioning documentation (VERSIONING.md, MIGRATION.md) for version-related changes
- Update inline code comments for significant logic changes
- Ensure all documentation remains accurate and current
- Documentation updates should be included in the same commit as the related code changes
- **Versioning Impact**: Consider if changes affect versioning strategy, Docker tags, or migration paths

## Development Best Practices

### Variable and Function Naming
- Use descriptive, self-documenting names for all variables and functions
- Prefer longer, clear names over abbreviations (e.g., `connectionString` vs `connStr`)
- Follow Go naming conventions: camelCase for unexported, PascalCase for exported
- Use constants for repeated string values to improve maintainability

### Test Management
- Always clean up test files and artifacts after test completion
- Use temporary directories for test data that get removed automatically
- Ensure tests don't leave persistent state that affects other tests
- Remove test databases and connections properly in teardown

### Repository Organization
- Keep the repository clean, organized, and human-readable
- Remove unused files, deprecated code, and temporary artifacts
- Maintain consistent file structure and naming conventions
- Update documentation immediately when making code changes

### Development Workflow
- **Quick Setup**: Use `./scripts/dev-setup.sh` for automated environment setup on new machines
- **Environment Check**: Run `make check-env` to verify all required tools are installed
- **Full Development**: Use `make dev-full` for complete development environment with monitoring
- **Frontend Preparation**: Use `make setup-frontend` to prepare structure for React (Phase 2)
- **Use pre-commit hooks**: Install and use pre-commit hooks for automatic quality checks (`pre-commit install`)
- **Alternative manual checks**: Run `make lint` before committing to ensure code quality
- Use `make all` for comprehensive quality checks (format, lint, test, build)
- Test both database backends (PostgreSQL and MariaDB) during development
- Maintain backwards compatibility with Radarr v3 API at all times
- **Documentation**: See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for comprehensive setup and troubleshooting guide
