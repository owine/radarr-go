# - AlertManager: http://localhost:9093
```

### 3. Security Hardening

```bash
# Run security scan

   ./deploy.sh health
   ```

2. **Log Review**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh logs radarr-go 100
   ```

3. **Performance Check**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh status
   ```

### Weekly Operations

1. **Backup Verification**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/backup-database.sh verify
   ```

2. **Security Updates**
